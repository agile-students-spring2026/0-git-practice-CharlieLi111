## Not a Coder? With A.I., Just Having an Idea Can Be Enough

[Read the full article on The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/technology/ai-coding-tools.html)

What got me thinking is: does this make learning CS pointless? I don't think so. AI can generate code for simple tools, but there's a huge gap between "it works" and actually understanding why it works. When the AI-generated code breaks or needs tweaking, you're stuck if you can't read what it wrote. It's like using Google Translate - helpful, but you wouldn't trust it for anything important without knowing the language yourself.

I see AI as a tool that becomes way more powerful when you actually know what you're doing. Someone with CS fundamentals can use AI to speed through boring code while focusing on the hard problems. But without that foundation, you're just hoping the AI understood your prompt correctly. The real value isn't just getting AI to write code - it's knowing enough to guide it properly and fix it when things go wrong.

I think what your are saying is pretty interesting. AI is able to self generate code and essentially improve itself. This is why lots of big tech companies are firing workers and relying more and more on AI for integration. However I think the lack of prompt control and oversight is lacking and needs to be controlled tighter. Our understanding of this tool is lacking and the technological advancement is going faster than our understand of what is being created. PS: article link no work
