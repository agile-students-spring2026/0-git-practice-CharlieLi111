[Not a Coder? With A.I., Just Having an Idea Can Be Enough]
(https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/technology/ai-coding-tools.html)

This article talks about how people with zero coding experience are now building apps using AI. A tech journalist who can't code created things like a podcast summarizer and a "LunchBox Buddy" app just by describing what he wanted to AI.

What got me thinking is: does this make learning CS pointless? I don't think so. AI can generate code for simple tools, but there's a huge gap between "it works" and actually understanding why it works. When the AI-generated code breaks or needs tweaking, you're stuck if you can't read what it wrote. It's like using Google Translate - helpful, but you wouldn't trust it for anything important without knowing the language yourself.

I see AI as a tool that becomes way more powerful when you actually know what you're doing. Someone with CS fundamentals can use AI to speed through boring code while focusing on the hard problems. But without that foundation, you're just hoping the AI understood your prompt correctly. The real value isn't just getting AI to write code - it's knowing enough to guide it properly and fix it when things go wrong.
